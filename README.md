***Description***

This project demonstrates the initial phase of a YouTube-like webpage, focusing on the layout of the landing page. The page is created using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or backend integration. It aims to replicate the basic look and feel of YouTube's main interface and serves as a static design, perfect for front-end learners and anyone interested in HTML/CSS web design.


***How It Works***

The project consists of a single HTML file and associated CSS styles. You can view it by following these steps:
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the project files.
3. Open the youtube.html file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
4. The YouTube landing page will be displayed in the browser.
   
***Technologies Used***

1. HTML (for structure)
2. CSS (for styling)

***How to Run the Project***

- Download or clone the repository to your computer.
- Open the folder containing the index.html file.
- Double-click the youtube.html file or right-click and choose "Open with" your preferred browser.

_*No additional software or configuration is needed to run the project since itâ€™s a static HTML/CSS implementation.*_

***Future Development***

This project represents the starting page and can be extended further with:
- JavaScript functionality
- Integration with a backend for dynamic content
- Enhanced responsiveness and mobile design improvements
